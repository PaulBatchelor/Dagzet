@14:33 Re-aquainting myself with this repo, hello logzet #logzet #timelog:00:05:25
I have this logging format that I have been using
for the past year or so. It's sort of adhoc, but
I have a few parsers for it. I'm hoping to make
a more established parser for it here. Similar
to dagzet, it'll parse files and return SQLite
code to produce relational databases.
---
I'm hoping to begin by adding a new aux binary
called logzet. I'd like to install it by default
with dagzet.
---
Well, that was pretty painless. Now for the harder
part, setting up the parser.

@14:42 Planning out the parser #timelog:00:17:31
For the most part, parsing is done line-by-line.
---
The start of the line determines what the line is
going to be.
---
An '@' at the start of the line
signifies the start of a block. What follows the @ determines
what kind of block it will be. For now, there are really two
types of blocks: blocks that indicate a date, and ones that
indicate a time.
---
Date Blocks: The format is YYYY-MM-DD?(#(TEXT)) (like my pseudo-regex?).
In the program, this thing sets the current day of the program.
The hashtag adds a tag for the day.
---
Time blocks: HH:MM (TITLE). This creates a log entry at a particular
time. A day block should be made before adding time. Everything following
the the timestamp (plus whitespace) is the title.
---
Titles in the time blocks can have hashtags. These do not get included in the
the actual title name, and should be automatically removed.


@15:20 continued parsing plans (describing the parser) #timelog:00:14:54
Lines that start with "#!" are logzet commands. Typically,
these come right after the line that starts a block,
but I don't think that needs to be the case.
---
The only command that is used currently is "dz", which
links the current log entry to a particular dagzet node.
---
A line that starts with '---', and nothing else, is considered
a break. Typically, I use these to break things into
paragraphs.
---
A line that starts with "===" begins a pre-formatted block, usually
used for code blocks. It preserve all line breaks and spaces until
it finds another lines starting with "===".
---
I think that's most of it?
---
OH! right. Empty lines are ignored.

@15:46 attack plan #timelog:00:31:06
I'm thinking I may have this be a two-pass parsing process.
The first pass tokenizes things by line, the second pass
parses these tokens to build up a more meaningful representation
of the data.
---
Tokenization is pretty straight forward. Use an enum.
Parse text line by line.
---
Plain text content in a block (anything that isn't a block
or metablock), can be stored line by line and merged later.
pre-formatted block starts change the behavior of the line
parser. Once a block starts, every line parsed after that
points becomes a preformatted line until it finds another
corresponding "===", which turns it off.
---
For logs, log entries are grouped by dates, and dates
can be grouped by category.
---
Claude has come up with suggestions for what to call
these things: A "Session" describes a combination of
a "Date" and an optional "Context". A Session contains
a group of log entries associated with that context.
---
Since dagzet support is also going to be wanted here,
there should be something that shows a list of
related nodes (represented as paths).
---
An Entry consists of a list of content chunks. Maybe
these are just called "blocks" (claude suggests this).
I want this log format to also be generalized in
terms of blocks, but that may be overgeneralizing.

@16:26 working out the initial data structures #timelog:00:47:38
I'm just gonna put them in the one file.
---
I'm thinking about source maps. I think the best way to
express this is as a generic struct that wraps
an inner type.
---
Got some initial structs down. Now, I want to create
some From traits for the lower-level statements.

@17:45 some initial From traits #timelog:00:11:12

@19:22 initial boilerplate: got "break" parsed #timelog:00:20:25

@19:43 attempting regex matching for Time #timelog:00:20:16
Ran out of time. Gotta get home.

@2025-08-18#logzet another hub session

@19:31 resuming where I left off, matches for Time #timelog:00:49:57
I got the basic regex working! now I need to add in
hashtags.

@20:21 Now a similar thing for Date #timelog:00:59:41
This will have a title. Might as well have hashtags?
This could be a generic.
---
Got the "context" hashtag working. Now getting the regular tags working?
---
Working!
